			 text="{=bretagne_kingdom_text}In 1100, the Duchy of Bretagne was ruled by Alan IV de Cornouaille of the House of Cornouaille. Although formally a vassal of the French king, the duchy in practice operated as an almost independent feudal state. Breton nobles played an active role in the Norman conquest of England—especially members of the House of Penthièvre, such as Brian de Bretagne, who received English lands from William the Conqueror. Alan IV further strengthened ties with the Norman dynasty by marrying Constance de Normandie, William’s daughter, creating a political alliance that linked Bretagne closely to both Normandy and England. In its foreign policy, the duchy sought to balance the competing influences of Anjou, Normandy, and France through participation in the Crusades and carefully arranged dynastic marriages. Despite growing pressure from the French crown, Bretagne preserved its own political institutions, language, and cultural identity. The Breton language and the ermine coat of arms—later a defining symbol of the region—remained central to its distinct character.">
