			 text="{=pisa_kingdom_text}Between the 11th and 13th centuries, the Republic of Pisa evolved from a provincial Tuscan city into one of the major maritime powers of the Mediterranean. In the 11th century, it effectively freed itself from the authority of the Margraviate of Tuscany and began building a formidable fleet, taking part in crusades, naval campaigns, and long‑distance trade. By the 12th century, Pisan ships dominated key sea routes, and the republic’s influence stretched across Sardinia, Corsica, and even the Balearic Islands. In 1114, Pisa launched a major naval expedition against Muslim pirates in Majorca, acting in alliance with Catalan forces. The 13th century marked the peak of Pisan power, when the republic stood as a rival to Genoa and Venice. However, the crushing defeat at the Battle of Meloria in 1284 signaled the beginning of Pisa’s decline.">
