			 text="{=saxony_kingdom_text}In the 12th century, Saxony was one of the most powerful duchies in the Holy Roman Empire. Between 1073 and 1075, Saxony rebelled against Heinrich IV. Rebellion was provoked by the centralization of power and aggressive exploitation of Saxony's lands. In 1100 it was ruled by Magnus Billung, the last male heir of the Billung dynasty, who died in 1106.  After Magnus's death, the duchy passed to Lothar von Supplinburg, who became emperor of Holy Roman Empire. This led to more internal struggles and further Saxony fragmentation.">
