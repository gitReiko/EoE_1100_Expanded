### Snowball dependency

Snowball adds new clans to kingdoms that conquer new settlements. This allows you to join a kingdom or create your own and simply play. Other kingdoms will also expand.

### Other optional mods

1. [Start As Anyone](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/8308)

Allows you to start playing for your favorite clan in the game. Join a kingdom or lead it.

### My future plans

- update my translations into Belarusian
- add and rework settlements to suit the needs of the mod
- add regional troop trees for cultures
- add Serbia kingdom (it was originally planned, but due to the impossibility of changing settlements, it has been postponed for the future.)
- move changes that do not increase system requirements to EoE 1100
- improve banners of all remaining kingdoms
- improve existing clans (add lords, etc.)
- add snowballs for all new kingdoms. Improve them.
- detailing other parts of the map. For example, the British Isles. England could be divided into two kingdoms (England and Normandy, struggle for the crown), Kingdom of the Isles could be added, and perhaps something could be done in Ireland and Scotland.
