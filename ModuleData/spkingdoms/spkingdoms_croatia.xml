			 text="{=croatia_kingdom_text}In the 11th century, the Croatian Kingdom was ruled by the Trpimirović dynasty, first under King Stephen I and later under his successor, Dmitar Zvonimir. Their domestic policy focused on strengthening royal authority, developing a feudal system, and supporting the Catholic Church, often in close cooperation with the papacy. In foreign affairs, Croatia carefully balanced between the influence of Byzantium and the Holy Roman Empire, while also maintaining ties with Hungary through dynastic marriages. After Zvonimir’s death in 1089, a succession crisis erupted, creating instability that allowed the Hungarian king Coloman to intervene. The final ruler of an independent Croatia, Petar Snačić, was killed in 1097 at the Battle of Mount Gvozd while resisting the Hungarian advance. In 1102, Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary, bringing an end to its political independence.">
